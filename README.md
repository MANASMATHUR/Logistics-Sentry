# TinyFish - Logistics Intelligence Sentry
Live Demo: [https://inventory-agent-three.vercel.app/](https://inventory-agent-three.vercel.app/)

A comprehensive logistics intelligence platform that helps supply chain teams track port congestion, carrier advisories, and operational risks across multiple sources simultaneously. Uses the **Discovery → Scouting → Synthesis** pipeline pattern with parallel Mino browser agents to provide real-time, source-backed operational signals.

## How Mino API is Used
The Mino API powers the core execution layer. The orchestrator deploys **multiple Mino Agents** to navigate the live DOM of target logistics sites, bypassing static API limitations. These agents extract "Deep Metrics" (wait times, vessel counts, specific alerts) and return structured operational signals.

## Intelligence Lifecycle
The following sequence diagram illustrates the end-to-end flow of a risk assessment, from discovery to synthesis.

```

## Risk Decision Logic
The system normalizes unstructured signals into a coherent risk level based on the following state logic.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Scanning
    
    Scanning --> Normal: No Negative Signals Found
    Scanning --> SignalsDetected: Metrics/Quotes Extracted
    
    SignalsDetected --> LowRisk: Minor Congestion (wait < 2 days)
    SignalsDetected --> MediumRisk: Moderate Congestion (wait 2-4 days)
    SignalsDetected --> HighRisk: Strike / Force Majeure / Severe Wait (> 4 days)
    
    LowRisk --> Monitoring: "Continue monitoring"
    MediumRisk --> AlertSubscriber: "Anticipate berthing delay"
    HighRisk --> CrisisAction: "Divert cargo immediately"
    
    Normal --> [*]
    Monitoring --> [*]
    AlertSubscriber --> [*]
    CrisisAction --> [*]
```

## Code Snippet
```javascript
// Example: Requesting a Risk Assessment in the Logistics Sentry
const response = await fetch("/api/logistics/risk-assessment", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    origin_port: "Port of Los Angeles",
    carrier: "Maersk",
    mode: "Sea Freight"
  }),
});

const data = await response.json();
// Returns a structured Risk Profile with confidence scores and root causes
```

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Mino API key (get from [mino.ai](https://mino.ai))

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manasmathur/Logistics-Sentry
   cd Logistics-Sentry
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure Environment**:
   Create a `.env.local` file with:
   ```bash
   MINO_API_KEY=xxx
   ```
4. **Run development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
